# Comparative Analysis of COVID 19 Fake and Reliable News
**The repository is used to store files which were used in the reseach of Covid-19 related news** 
The motivation behind this research is fully academic, as we were curious about the usage of network statistics with language data. During our projects we used several methods - ERGM, Sentiment analysis using premarked lexicons, and pairwise corr for nets. The whole research was based on agenda theory, according to which media coverage of a topic has an impact on public awareness of it. All credentials, abstract, and used literature can be found in the paper.

**The main code plots topwords for both fake and true headings. Adding to exponential models the the branch with network census is in progress.**
